# TDEX

TDEX is a Decentralized Exchange that facilitates trustless, low friction exchange of TTC based assets. It is now available on Mobile application TTC Connect.

## Key Features
	
- TDEX realizes every process (order, cancel, matching and execution) through Smart Contracts.
- In TDEX, users own the custody and control of their assets and all the transactions are processed securely through Smart Contracts. Such structure protects the assets safely from unauthorized attacks on wallets and servers.
- TTC blockchain enables hundreds of transactions to be processed per block and each transaction to be completed within 6 seconds, from order, match to transfer.


TDEX is under development and subject to frequent changes, upgrades, and bug fixes. We appreciate your help in providing feedback and working around rough edges as we build towards a better product.
